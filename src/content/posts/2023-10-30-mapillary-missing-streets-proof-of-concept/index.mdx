## This Post is WIP. Best to ignore it for now…

This projects has been in my mind for a few years now. And on the recent [Hackweekend in Berlin](https://www.fossgis.de/news/2023_10_22_hackweekend_berlin/) it was finally time to create this proof of concept. Let's have a look at what this is, for now…

## Backstory

In Berlin, we have quite an [active Mapillary Community](https://www.mapillary.com/app/leaderboard/542609?location=Berlin%2C+Germany&focus=map&lat=52.523460832607356&lng=13.38212698771747&z=11.316230389043383) providing us with a constant flow of freh imagery. This data is essential when it comes to explore projects like the [Straßenraumkarte](https://strassenraumkarte.osm-berlin.org/) and the [street parking project](https://parkraum.osm-verkehrswende.org/regions/berlin/).

For the last few years most of our most active contributors switched to 360° GoPro Max Cameras.
